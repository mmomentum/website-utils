# website-utils
A selection of small utility plugins used on my wordpress website;

### Bulk EDD Discount Codes
Used for mass generation of a bunch of Easy Digital Downloads discount codes at 100% off. Name & Product restriction is available. The admin interface for using this can be found inside of the Easy Digital downloads menu.

### Username Restriction
Stores a selection of "Forbidden Terms" that, when provided as a registration username, will return an error and not create the account. Used as a *very* basic anti-spam mechanism. The interface for using this can be found inside of Wordpress' settings menu.
